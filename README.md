The objective of this project was to analyze sales data from a supermarket and derive meaningful insights. By exploring the dataset, we aimed to understand revenue patterns, popular products, customer behavior, and payment preferences.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains historical sales records from a supermarket company across three branches in Myanmar (Yangon, Mandalay, Naypyitaw).
Variables include branch information, product lines, gender, payment methods, and sales quantities.
Key Findings
Branch Sales:
Sales across the three branches (A, B, C) are relatively consistent.
Branch A has slightly higher sales than the other branches.
Payment Methods:
E-wallet is the most popular payment method, followed by credit cards and cash.
Spending Patterns:
Females spend more on “fashion accessories.”
Males allocate more spending toward “Health and beauty.”
Both genders spend significantly on “Food and beverages.”
Product Prioritization:
Supermarkets should prioritize “Fashion accessories” and “Health and beauty” products.
Recommendations
Promote E-wallet usage for convenience.
Tailor marketing strategies based on gender-specific spending patterns.
Optimize inventory for popular product categories.
